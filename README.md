# Battleship

## Billy Burch and Miranda Delaney


Reflection questions:

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

When reading through the functionality checklist, we made notes about what possible classes we would need to give function to components of the game. It was clear we needed a game class, a player class and a computer class. Then we made notes of what each of those might contain to achieve gameplay. We followed set up guidelines that we were familiar with from previous projects.


If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

Billy - Go back to the game class file and revisit it with an eye for slimming down the code in the interest of readability and efficiency. I'm pleased we were able to meet the functionality requirements, but I'm sure there is a more efficient way to have done so.

Miranda - Refactor some tests and add more intelligence to the computer firing(have computer make smarter guesses). 

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We estimate about 75% of this project was done switching between driver and navigator. When things reached a certain level of complexity and we needed some individual work and reflection time to move forward, we then divided up next steps and communicated consistently through any times we were working solo.

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Since we were mostly using the driver/navigator style, feedback was simultaneous to coding(as one was navigating, the other was welcomed to give input). When we worked solo, we shared our tests and code in a screen share huddle and ran through the game together to ensure one or the other didn't miss any bugs.
